# Buffers

__Buffers__ are not, as I was told at Galvanize, a "big, string-like thing that will make no sense to you." Let's do better.

Simply put, a buffer is a temporary holding place for data that is being moved form one place to another. Buffers are intentionally limited in size because we want to move data quickly.

A quick aside to put this into perspective. A __stream__ is a sequence of data made available over time. In other words, streams are pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole. Just like water flowing through a stream, data flows through a streams as it is being passed from one process to another or from one computer to another. Streams, when combined with buffers, allow us to process data "as we go".

For example, let's say you would like to watch a movie over the internet. If you attempted to download the movie it would be time consuming. However, when you stream a movie, you download chunks of a movie that you are watching. You're still downloading the movie, but you're now able to download, process, and watch at both at the same time with the use of a stream and a buffer.

As you can see, a buffer collects data in a limited allocation of memory to allow you to process data as it continues to stream from one process to another or from one computer to another.

That was a bit of a tangent, but I wanted to give you an Idea about where I was heading. Buffers, you can see, are areas in memory, that will temporarily store that data and allow us to subsequently process it in chunks.

## Terms
* __Data Buffer__ - A data buffer is a region of physical memory storage that is used to _temporarily_ store data while it is being moved from one place to another. The buffer stores data as it is retrieved from an input device or immediately before it is sent to an output device. It can also be used when data is to be moved between processes within a computer.
* __Binary Data__ - data that is stored in sets of 0s and 1s
  * Core tenant of the math that computers are based on. Each one or zero is called a __bit__ or __binary digit__. 010101 = 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^1 = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 Binary is base 2 representation of a number.
* __Character Set__ - A representation of characters as numbers or a defined list of characters that are recognized by computer hardware and software and where each character is represented by a number (Unicode and ASCII).
* __Character Encoding__ - How characters are actually stored in binary. How many bits are used to represent each number. The more bits, the more chars, the more sophisticated language/characters you can represent. The numbers, or __code points__, of a character set are converted and stored in binary. Character encoding is a representation of characters by some kind of encoding system like bit patterns, octets, natural numbers, UTF-8, data storage, etc.

## JavaScript and Buffers

Prior to the introduction of the `TypedArray` in ES6, JavaScript did not have a way to read or manipulate streams of binary data. Remember, JavaScript was intended to be used to manipulate the DOM, so it was designed to handle unicode-encoded strings. However, Node.js _does_ need to be able to manipulate binary data when dealing with TCP streams and reading and writing to the filesystem. Initially, Node.js' solution to this problem was to use strings to represent binary data. However, this approach was not ideal, so buffers were incorporated into the language.

The `Buffer` class was introduced as part of the Node.js API to allow JavaScript to interact with octet streams in the context of TCP streams and file system operations.
* The `Buffer` class is a global feature within Node.jds and handles binary-handling tasks with a binary buffer implementation, which is exposed as a JS API under the buffer pseudo-class.
* Buffers act somewhat like arrays of integers, but they are not resizable and have methods designed specifically for handling and manipulating binary data.
* the 'integers' in a buffer each represent a byte, which means that they are limited to values from 0 - 255.
* Raw data is stored in an instance of the buffer class, which is similar to an array of integers. However, buffers are actually corresponded to raw memory outside of V8. Because of this, it cannot be resized.
* In order to save space and be more readable, the designers of Node.js chose to display __hexadecimal__ numbers instead of binary numbers. Therefore, an 8 digit binary number is represented by a 2 digit hexadecimal number, and that is why you will see a two digit representation of a byte in the buffer.

Many times data that Node.js developers will be using are from the filesystem or TCP streams, which are octet streams. As we've mentioned before, JavaScript is not well-suited for manipulating this form of data.

### Creating Buffers:
Buffers can be created in a few ways:
* `const buffer = new Buffer(8);`
  * the buffer is initialized with 8 bytes
* `const buffer = new Buffer('Some Example Test', 'utf-8');`
  * the buffer is initialized to the binary encoding of the first string as defined by the second argument.
* `const buffer = new Buffer([ 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9 ]);`
  * the buffer is initialized to the contents of the array - the contents are integers that represent bytes.

##### Types of Character sets (encoding)
* __ascii__ - Fast but limited to the ascii char set; Null chars will be converted into spaces
* __ucs2__ - Two-byte, little-endian encoding; can encode a subset of unicode. Alias of `utf16le`
* __base64__ - base64 string encoding
* __binary__ - binary string format mentioned earlier - is being depreciated, so avoid using this
* __utf-8__ - Multibyte encoded Unicode Chars. Many web pages use UTF-8

### Writing to Buffers

If we have a buffer created, we can start writing strings to it:
```js
const buffer = new Buffer(20);

buffer.write('Hello', 'utf-8')

// => 5
```
__buffer.write__

##### Arguments:
1. String to write to the Buffer
2. String encoding (defaults to utf-8)

`buffer.write` can optionally take 3 arguments. In the case of 3 arguments:
1. String to write to the Buffer
2. Indicates an offset, or the index of the buffer to start writing
3. String encoding (defaults to utf-8)

### Reading from Buffers

##### toString
Calling `toString` an a buffer with the encoding as an argument will transmit the data in a usable format.

```js
buffer.toString('utf-8')
//  => 'Hello world!\u0000ï¿½k\t'
```
Because we know the length of the buffer, we can add more arguments to 'stringify' the slice to retrieve the data we are interested in. For example:

```js
buffer.toString('utf-8', 0, 12);

// => 'Hello world!'
```

##### Individual Octets:
You can also set individual bits through an array-like syntax.

### Other Buffer Methods

#### Buffer.isBuffer
Method to check if `object` is a buffer

#### Buffer.byteLength(string, encoding)
Method to check the number of bytes required to encode a string with a given encoding.

> Buffer.byteLength !== string.length

#### buffer.length
Will return the length of the buffer and represents the amount of memory that is allocated. Note that it is not the same as the size of the buffer's contents, since a buffer not be filled.

#### buffer.slice(start, end=buffer.length)
This method is similar to Array.prototype.slice but with an important distinction:
* the slice is __not__ a new buffer. It is a reference to a subset fo the memory space.
* Therefore, if you modify the slice, you will modify the buffer.


## TL:DR
1. Buffers a finite amount of data and store hexadecimal representations of said raw binary data
2. Buffer behaves like an Array

#### ES6 Typed arrays
```js
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8); // stores raw binary data (64 bits) A feature of Vanilla JS
const view = new Int32Array(buffer) // an array that allows you to work with the buffer. Will conver the buffer into the format that you need to work with.
view[0] = 5; // converted into 32 bits
view[1] = 15;
view[2] = 30 // buffer does not have storage space
console.log(view);

// => Int32Array { '0': 5, '1': 15 }
```
View allows you to work with binary data in an easier way (through base 10 numbers)
